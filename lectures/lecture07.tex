1:20 central limit, theorem, etc. didn’t come into use from the building and design of the estimator, but rather when analyzing the estimator

The dataset is available in R.


The runners are the omegas. We are interested in measurements on those guys.  The random variable here is running time.

The running times turn out to be a 
Gaussian distribution

Does the distribution in 2012 have the same distribution in 2009?

This question is a hypothesis testing problem.

Are they running faster? All we care about is the expectation.  We fix the variance.

By limiting modeling assumptions, we are limiting the number of ways the l hypothesis can be rejected see slide

Want to add a buffer because of CLT’s $1/\sqrt{n}$
