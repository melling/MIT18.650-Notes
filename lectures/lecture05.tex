\marginpar{5m} The estimator is some function multiplied by the PMF/PDF??

Remove log because in an increasingly function, theta won’t change

\marginpar{11:30} The likelihood is the joint density??

\marginpar{18m} Concave functions have a negative second derivative everywhere

Concise Bernoulli PMF

\subsection{Poisson Likelihood}


\subsection{Gaussian Likelihood}

\marginpar{57:30} Keep the random variables for as long as you can.  The estimators are functions of rv’s. Plug in data at the end.

\marginpar{1:11:00} Fischer information is the second derivative or Hessian.
The curvature is the variance of the first derivative. A larger Fischer information value is better.  The larger, the more curvy it is.
